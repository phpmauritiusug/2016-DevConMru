# Autoloading, Composer and application architecture

_This session is the second of a series of 3, which will learn you how to build your PHP website from scratch, to a world class Laravel application, while deeply understanding what's going on backstage, giving you complete control over every little detail._

From handmade autoloading to using Composer as a dependency management tool, we will dive in how we can create better PHP applications at all development stages : designing, hardcoding, testing and deploying.

## Summary

- From a set of source code files to a designed layout
- Wrapping concepts in classes
- Understanding closure / anonymous functions
- Autoloading your code manually

## Setting up your environment

You can simply re-use the same environment we created [during the first session](https://github.com/phpmauritiusug/2016-DevConMru/tree/master/PHP-01-1-JumpStart#setting-up-your-environment), and replace the content of the `/var/www` folder from your virtual machine with the content you will find in the `code` folder in this repository.

Thanks to Vagrant, following the examples for setting up the environment, the content of the virtual `/var/www` folder is in `/your/folder/2016-DevConMru/PHP-01-1-JumpStart/vagrant-env`: no use to vagrant SSH, you can use your favorite text editor right now!
